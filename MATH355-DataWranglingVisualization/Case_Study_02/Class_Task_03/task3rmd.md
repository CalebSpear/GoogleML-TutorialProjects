## Is there a correlation between percent Islam of a country and latitude/longitude? Or climate.
Some people thought this could be an interesting question but it's not 
really a question that would be of any particular benefit. I couldn't
find examples of other people addressing this question. 

## Does the number of languages a person speaks correlate with income?
This question could help answer how useful it is to speak multiple languages and could be answered within two months. Other people have addressed if the ability to speak English affects earnings and which languages help people earn more. These question might be easier to find data for.

## How far can the Rexburg Fire department reasonably cover in Madison County?
This question is something that the fire department wants addressed so they can have this information for insurance purposes. People seemed to think this was a cool idea. Depending on the level of accuracy of the project this can be done within two months but could take longer to do well.
